Steps to run:
1. start SpanishCastleMagic; this is the equivalent of the RMI repository
2. start zProofOfConceptServer
3. start zProofOfConcertClient

if you have trouble compiling, then remove the class folder requirements from SpanishCastleMagic. Then re-add them because they are needed for the thing to run.
